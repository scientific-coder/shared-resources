* Goals
Exclusive private property is so passé: welcome to the area of
polyownership !

Joint ownership and lending meet the social web.

While property is not always a theft, Total Cost of Ownsership including
storage doesn't make it a steal either.
Why hoard things that you rarely use ? Renting isn't always an option
and get expensive pretty fast. Lending is find, but doesn't
always scale.

What we propose is for people to share goods amongst communities.

Their should be plugable rules for handling:
- communities (joining, leaving,…)
- goods circulations (request queues, dispatch approval, lending duration,…)
- …

** Example usage
** books
I have stacks of books everywhere in my apartment (and basement, and
parking lot). They'd be more useful on someone else shelves.
** tools
I have a drill press, hammer drill and a ripper that I use once in a while.

* TODO Gather interested parties
There are *no* deadlines, the road traveled is as important as the
destination. Getting to use interesting technologies for an
interesting project is what it's all about. Any input, be it advice,
testing or actual code, is more than welcome.

Taking into account the hosting choices.

* TODO choose license
[[https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html][GPL v3]] or later ?

* TODO choose technologies
** hosting
Choices shouldn't be exclusive to avoid lock-in and should allow free
development hosting.
*** Heroku

*** Openshift

*** Digital Ocean

**** We could do without any Clojure Web server               :controversial:
Serve only the code for client for a Single Page Web App and have
(RESTful ?) web services to handle AJAX.

*** TODO database
